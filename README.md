Online loan Management System (OLMS) is a project that is taken 
and being developed by us is to apply for loans online. Customers 
need to enter loan applications online. Staff or admin has the 
authority to approve or reject loan applications. Customer can 
view their Loan account detail, Interest rate, repayment schedule 
details, etc. Customers can make loan payments online. After the 
payment, the system updates with the total paid amount and balance 
amount. Administrators can view payment details, loan account details, 
pending payment details, and do terminate the accounts, etc.
