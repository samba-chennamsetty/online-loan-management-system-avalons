	Online loan Management System (OLMS) is a project that is taken and being developed by us is to apply for loans online. Customers need to enter loan applications online. Staff or admin has the authority to approve or reject loan applications. Customer can view their Loan account detail, Interest rate, repayment schedule details, etc. Customers can make loan payments online. After the payment, the system updates with the total paid amount and balance amount. Administrators can view payment details, loan account details, pending payment details, and do terminate the accounts, etc.

	ADMIN:
		Admin is the one who verifies the user or the customer who is going to register itself on the loan management system. There can be only one account of admin and all other accounts can be either of user or customer. After verifying the customerâ€™s loan request admin can approve the loan and the respected information will update in the system with the calculated interest amount. And admin can able to update customer profiles and add or delete accounts.

	CUSTOMER:
		A customer has to register himself in the application to apply loan for any type of home loan, study loan, car loan, etc. Once customer registration completes he can log in with the given credentials in the user module.  Once the customer logins he has made a loan request with the amount, duration, and interest rate. Then Customers loan request goes to the admin module, and if approves, the requested information for that customer will update in the system.
